🌱 MarsCropPredictor
Predicting soil nutrient content and water requirements for sustainable agriculture on Mars!
🚀 About the Project
MarsCropPredictor is an innovative machine-learning project designed to support agriculture in extraterrestrial environments, specifically on Mars. This tool leverages data-driven insights to predict soil nutrient properties and water requirements for various crops, ensuring optimal growth conditions in a challenging environment.

By training a multi-output regression model on simulated Martian soil data, this project enables efficient resource management and agricultural planning for future Mars colonization efforts.
🧑‍🔬 Features
Multi-Crop Prediction: Provides predictions for soil nutrient content and water levels for five crops (rice, wheat, ragi, cotton, and tomato).
Data-Driven Insights: Uses a Random Forest-based machine learning model for accurate predictions.
Interactive Visualizations: Displays nutrient content and water level predictions for better understanding.
Flexible Inputs: Easily analyze the impact of soil properties like pH, moisture, and temperature on crop performance.

⚙️ How It Works
Data Input: Provide Martian soil parameters such as pH, moisture, and temperature.
Model Training: The Random Forest-based MultiOutputRegressor model is trained using crop data with varying soil and water properties.
Prediction: The trained model predicts nutrient content and water requirements for five crops.
Visualization: The results are visualized as bar and line graphs for easy interpretation.
